**This project is no longer maintained. I have no use for this particularly since I tend to use the native tools installed on remote servers and installing a 3rd party tool is not possible. Feel free to fork if you are interested.**


A CLI based Swiss Army Knife for Developer. Inspired by [DevToys](https://github.com/veler/DevToys).
